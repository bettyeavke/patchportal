# PatchPortal

## Description
PatchPortal is a Python-based application designed to centralize the management of updates and patches for Windows software. It provides a simplified interface to check for available updates and apply necessary patches for installed applications on a Windows system.

## Features
- Retrieve a list of all installed software on the system.
- Check for available updates for each installed software.
- Apply patches to specific software applications.

## Requirements
- Windows Operating System
- Python 3.x
- Administrator privileges (for accessing installed software details)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patchportal.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd patchportal
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the PatchPortal script:
   ```bash
   python patch_portal.py
   ```
2. The program will display the list of installed software and their update status.
3. To apply a patch, use the `apply_patch` method with the software name as an argument.

## Limitations
- The current version uses placeholder logic for checking and applying updates. Integration with actual update services or APIs is required for full functionality.
